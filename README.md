# Cyber-Guard-Name-Generator
100 Days of Code: Day 1 - Cyber Guard Name Generator

A simple Python program that generates strong and secure-sounding names for cybersecurity firms.

## How It Works

1. The program starts by welcoming the user and explaining its purpose.
2. It then asks the user for three pieces of information:
   - The last city they visited.
   - Their favorite color.
   - Their favorite number.
3. Finally, it combines these inputs to generate and display a unique Cyber Guard name.

## Example

Let's say the user inputs the following:
- Last city visited: "Paris"
- Favorite color: "Blue"
- Favorite number: "7"

The program will output:
Your Cyber Guard name could be Paris Blue 7
